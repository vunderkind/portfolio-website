            <p class="intro-text">One of my favorite show dialogues comes from 'The Pretender'. A lady asks The Pretender, 'are you a doctor?'. He replies, charmingly, 'I am today'. <br>In many ways, I was an ersatz Pretender: able to quickly patch together a Frankenstein's Monster of technical solutions to things without knowing the philosophy or best practices for doing them. <br>That came with a toll: first, a false sense of knowledge; and secondly, the inability to truly build anything meaningful. <br>With the help of Lambda School, I am leaving my Pretender days behind and learning, for once, to be a software developer. If the fox knows many things and the hedgehog knows one big thing, I am the fox. <br>Ek is die jakkals.</p>

The final outcome of this project will be a game you can play in-browser, but in the meantime, you have the ability to manipulate the paddle at the bottom using your left and right.
